show collections            //shows collections in db
db.customer.insertOne({name:"Mark", age:25, gender:"Male"})
//The keys dont have to have "" as long as there isnt any white soace in it

db.customer.find()      //Shows all documents in customer collection
//Every document has a unique id which mongoDB adds implicitly
//_id:ObjectId("615165asfgfbgbwsf315")

db.customer.insertOne({_id:"jhasvdjasbc", name:"Marcus", age:25, gender:"Male"})
//Here we are manually adding the id for the document
//MongoDB wont allow multiple documents with same id
