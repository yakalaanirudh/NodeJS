db.customer.find()      //Find method returns a pointer(cursor) that points to the list of docs

//Suppose there 23 docs, find returns only 20
we ahve to type it for the next 3
find returnd docs in batches, the batches are called cursor
find method wont return all docs at once

db.customer.find().toArray()    this requests for the next batch till all are returned
//toArray asks mongoDB to return next cursor till all docs are returned

foreach is another cursor method
this forEach method requests for the next batch till all are returned
//forEach asks mongoDB to return next cursor till all docs are returned
db.customer.forEach(function(){print("customer name: "+cust.name)}) 

pretty method can only be called on a cursor
